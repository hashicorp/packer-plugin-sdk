## 0.1.1 (March 31, 2021)

### Notes

In release [v0.0.12](#0012-february-11-2021) a backwards incompatible change was introduced to the
    packer-plugin-sdk with the update to v1.2.4 for the `ugorji/go/codec`
    package. Plugins built with a version of the Packer SDK prior to v0.0.12
    are encouraged to update to the latest possible version of the SDK to
    prevent potential codec marshalling issues with Packer v1.7.0 and higher.

### Features

* commonsteps/http_config: Add `http_content` configuration option as an
    alternative method for serving static HTTP content. This option works
    similar to `http_directory` but has the ability to serve files that include
    Go templating variables that can be interpolated at runtime by Packer core.
